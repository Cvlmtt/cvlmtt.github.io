    <h2 class="section-title">Why this collection?</h2>
    <p>
    This repository was created as a personal archive. The walkthroughs it contains were written primarily as personal notes and as an exercise in technical writing. As a result, some guides may include verbose explanations and high-level descriptions of what even the most common tools are and how they are used. They are intentionally very beginner-friendly, often covering basic commands and details that more experienced readers might consider obvious or trivial.
    <br>
    At the same time, I hope these guides can be useful to anyone who is approaching this type of “game” for the first time.
